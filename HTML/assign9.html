A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.
A computer is a general purpose  device that can be programmed to carryout a set of arithemt and logical operations.since a sequence of operations can be rapidly c

	hanged.the computer can solve more than one problem
	<h1>cpu</h1>
	CPU  is the abbreviation for central processing unit.The central processing unit (CPU) is the unit, which performs most of the processing inside a computer. To control instructions and data flow to and from other parts of the computer, the CPU relies heavily on a chip set, which is a group of microchips located on the motherboard.
	<h1>alu</h1>
	An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer. An ALU is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations.
	<h1>PGOGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h1>
	A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.

<h1>c</h1>
C is a high-level and general-purpose programming language that is ideal for developing firmware or portable applications. Originally intended for writing system software, C was developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix Operating System in the early 1970s.

<h1>c++</h1>
C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation
